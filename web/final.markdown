title: Final project
---

Overview/important dates
------------------------

For CIS 194 you will complete a final project which will tie together
some of the things you have learned and give you some practical
Haskell development experience.

  * **Monday, March 18** -- Project proposals due
  * **April 8--12** -- Project checkpoints
  * **Tuesday, April 23** -- Final project submission deadline

Get started early!

Resources
---------

Here is a document explaining a few things relevant to
[Haskell programming in the large](/docs/inthelarge.pdf).

Format
------

You may work by yourself, or in groups of up to *three* students.
Note, however, that projects for groups of three will be held to
somewhat higher standards than those for individuals or pairs.  Groups
of five are *right out*.

*More information coming soon!*

<!--

There are two types of projects you may complete:

1. Application/library

    For your project you may write some sort of Haskell application or
    library which does something fun/useful/interesting.  Your
    imagination is the limit.  Some possibilities/suggestions include:

    + A program to play a game (like tic-tac-toe or Connect 4) against
      the user.
      
    + A program to generate random mazes and let the user
      interactively solve them.
      
    + An implementation of some interesting data structure like
      red-black trees, 2-3-4 trees, or Fibonacci heaps.
      
    + Whatever else your creativity suggests!

2. Open-source contribution
 
    For your project you may choose an open-source library or
    application on [Hackage](http://haskell.org/hackage/) to
    contribute to.  Contributions may include bug fixes, new features,
    and/or documentation.  Here are a few suggestions---these are
    projects whose authors/maintainers have indicated that there would
    be good ways for beginning Haskell students to contribute.  (But
    you are free to work on any project you like, as long as you can
    find a reasonable way to contribute.)  If you want to try
    contributing to one of these projects, you should contact the
    relevant person and discuss it with them prior to submitting your
    project proposal.

-->

Project proposal
----------------

You must submit a project proposal by **Monday, March 18**.  This
gives us a chance to discuss your proposal and ensure it will make a
suitable project.  You are encouraged to submit your proposal earlier
than March 18 if you already have an idea.  You should also feel
free to submit several project proposals if you would like help
deciding which is most suitable.

Checkpoint
----------

*More information coming soon.*

 <!--
By **Thursday, April 12** you must submit whatever work you have
completed so far on your project, along with a **text file describing
your progress**.  The work itself will not be graded, but you will
receive a grade based on the amount of progress you have made: it
should be evident that you have already spent at least a few hours
working on your project.  It's not necessarily a problem if you have
no work to show for your time yet (as may easily be the case for
open-source contributions in particular), as long as the submitted
text file makes it clear what you have spent your time doing.  For
example, your text file should include the following sorts of
information:

  * Anything you have spent time reading, along with a summary of what
    you learned from it

  * Examples or demos you have played with and a summary of what you
    learned

  * Difficulties or challenges you have faced

  * Choices or decisions you have made (what to focus on, what
    tools/libraries to use, etc.) and why you chose the way you did

  * What you plan to do next

This is not an exhaustive list; feel free to write about anything you
think may be helpful in demonstrating your progress.
 -->

Final submission
----------------

Final submissions are due by **Tuesday, April 23**.  Extensions to the
final deadline will be cheerfully granted, but you *must ask for one
in advance*.  Otherwise, the deadline is firm.

Your final submission should consist of any and all code you have
written, along with a document describing your project (a simple text
file is fine).  The document should contain

  * a description of your project and what you accomplished;
  
  * instructions on how to compile/run/try out/play with your project;

  * a description of work you did and things you learned along the way.

Grading will be as follows:

  * Style (25%).  Your project should use good Haskell style and be
    well-documented.
    
  * Correctness (25%).  Your project should be free of compilation
    errors and should correctly accomplish whatever it is supposed to
    accomplish.  This means that if the deadline is looming, your time
    would be better spent fixing bugs in what you already have than
    adding one last feature.
    
  * Effort/accomplishment (50%).  We will be looking for evidence that
    you put energy and effort (~10 hours at a minimum) into your
    project and that you have learned something.  This is where the
    document you submit along with your project comes in: be sure to
    use it to highlight work you did and things you learned,
    especially if it is not obvious from looking at the final product.
    For example, if you spent two hours trying an approach that
    ultimately did not work, you should write about that and what you
    learned from the experience.  However, we will not necessarily
    look with sympathy on *unnecessary* work: for example, if you
    spent five hours trying to track down a bug without asking for
    help, that's just plain silly stubbornness.  If you are stuck on
    something, please ask for help.  We want you to spend your time
    making progress on your project, not banging your head against a
    wall (although a small amount of head-banging can be healthy).
